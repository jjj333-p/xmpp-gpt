# xmppGPT

It doesnt do much yet but here's something I guess.
I was excited to start on it and then it started to feel like work.
Stay tuned to see if I pick it back up!

The idea is to copy [ariGPT](https://ari.lt/gpt/) 
(source: [py](https://git.ari.lt/ari.lt/ari.lt/src/branch/newera/src/aw/gpt.py),
[html](https://git.ari.lt/ari.lt/ari.lt/src/branch/newera/src/templates))

So far basically all I've done is add html templates that render out to:
<img width="1645" height="1037" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/188520b1-6a05-4421-9c29-89fff3b53243" />
<img width="1652" height="1033" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b49b39ea-5eaf-4bd0-a620-c12fdfc25959" />
